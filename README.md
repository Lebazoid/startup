## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Mythical Magical Monsters is the place to be to explore everything about King of the Beasts, the thrilling fantasy novel by Caleb Lay! Not every book series has its own dedicated website, and the ones that do don't give you an opportunity to get to know the magical world and characters that they will be reading about. This site provides a way for readers to do exactly that! They can read all about the backstories of their favorite characters and where they came from, and learn all about the awesome world the story takes place in, as well as read the first chapter if they're not sure about the book yet.

### Key Features

The site will feature multiple elements that make the experience fun and accessible to the user. Some of these are...

* A home page where users can navigate the site.
* Free access to the first chapter of the book.
* A page with drop down menus for each of the main characters, with all sorts of information on them.
* Links to my other creative projects in the bottom of the main page.
* Login and Profile pages.
* A small and very simple discussion forum.

### Technology

Multiple technologies will be used to host this site. These are the ones I plan to use so far.

* HTML - HTML will be used to structure the website. There will be 5 HTML pages, for login, for profile, for the discussion forum, the first chapter, the character page, and the map.
* CSS - CSS will be used to design and theme the site, so that it looks cool and consistent across all platforms.
* Javascript - Javascript will be used for login, map interaction, and the discussion forum.
* AWS - Amazon webservices will host the site. Their servers will store people's profile information, posts, and replies.
* Websocket - Enables realtime discussion on the forum.
* React - Assist development in Javascript.

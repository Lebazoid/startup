# Startup
## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
So many people love to play their favorite trading card games online, but they run into paywalls, or there just isnâ€™t a suitable software available! This is *Clash!* A site made for that exact reason. It is an easily customizable deck builder with an interactive multiplayer battlefield, complete with a pre-existing database of cards for the game *Mythic Magic Monsters*, created by me. It will make this fun and exciting card game available to everyone who wants to play it, completely free of charge!

### Key Features

*Clash* will feature multiple elements that make the experience fun and accessible to the user. Some of these are...

* Secure login and profile creation.

* A powerful deck editor, complete with card visuals, quick adding and quick removing cards, sorting and save functions.

* A profile page where users can save and showcase the decks they've made, as well as flaunt that incredible win record.

* Players can invite their friends to join them for a game.
* Players can use any of the decks they've built to play with.
*  Interactive battlefield that updates for both players in real time.
* Public rankings for players, and for popular cards/decks.

### Technology

Multiple technologies will be used to host this site. These are the ones I plan to use so far.

* HTML - HTML will be used to structure the website. There will be 5 HTML pages, for login, for profile, for the deck builder, for the battlefield, and for the home page with the rankings. 
* CSS - CSS will be used to design and theme the site, so that it looks cool and consistent across all platforms.
* Javascript - Javascript will be used for login, interactive deck building, interactive game-playing, and scores.
* AWS - Amazon webservices will host the site. Their servers will store people's profile information, saved decks, and scores.
* Websocket - Enables realtime multiplayer interaction on the game field.
* React - Assist development in Javascript.

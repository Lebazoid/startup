## Elevator Pitch
So many people love to play their favorite trading card games online, but they run into monetary barriers, or there just isnâ€™t a suitable software available! This is *Clash!* A site made for that exact reason. It is an easily customizable deck builder with an interactive multiplayer battlefield, complete with a pre-existing database of cards for the game *Mythic Magic Monsters*. As players compete, their win/loss records will be made available on a public ranking, and cards will be ranked from most to least popular. 

*Please note that names are subject to change.*

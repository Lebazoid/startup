## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

This website is the perfect place to discover and discuss the book, King of the Beasts, by Caleb Lay. This site features multiple different pages to get readers engaged, and talk to others about their favorite parts of the book!

### Key Features

* A map of Aldea, the country the book takes place in.
* A page where visitors can get to know the characters.
* A link to amazon where viewers can buy the book.
* A discussion board with customizable profile names.

### Technology

Multiple technologies will be used to host this site. These are the ones I plan to use so far.

* HTML - HTML will be used to structure the website. There will be 5 HTML pages, for login, for profile, for the discussion forum, the first chapter, the character page, and the map.
* CSS - CSS will be used to design and theme the site, so that it looks cool and consistent across all platforms.
* Javascript - Javascript will be used for login, the character introductions, and the discussion forum.
* AWS - Amazon webservices will host the site. Their servers will store people's profile information, posts, and replies.
* Websocket - Enables realtime discussion on the forum.
* React - Assist development in Javascript.

## CSS Deliverable

This deliverable completely overhauled the site. First and foremost, I added color, images, and styling to the existing html, making it look presentable and giving it a nice rustic aesthetic. 

On the main page of the site, viewers are presented a stack of books that they can click on and be redirected to a place to buy the book when it comes out.

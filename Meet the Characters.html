      <img src="Ezlo_image" alt="Ezlo Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>The brave young prince of Ostend! He takes pride in the title, and wants to live up to the good name.
          Since the age of 5 he trained in Ostend's own Knight Academy, and was consistently top of his class.
          His efforts were acknowledged by his father, who began training him on his own with another student, Lloyd,
          at the age of 12. He wields a magical flame blade that casts brilliants flames at enemies, but he seems
          to lag behind his classmate -  a fact that frustrates him deeply. He dreams of surpassing Lloyd and proving himself
          to his father.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Amber</button>
      <img src="Amber_image" alt="Amber Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>Amber is a young girl who lives peacefully in the countryside, but her heart longs for 
          adventure. Since she was young, she had masterful control of a paintbrush, and her paintings 
          adorn a wall in every palace in Aldea, although she goes by the pseudonym "Vinivier." When she finds
          Ezlo bruised and battered, she wonders if he will be the knight in shining armor that takes her
          on her long awaited adventure.

        <!-- Paula-->
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Paula</button>
      <img src="Paula_image" alt="Paula Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>A mysterious and enigmatic woman with brilliant green hair, and the head of Mila's widely respected
          mercenary guild. She was raised by monks from a young age, and is adept at many magical arts, including
          wielding the divine bow Celestia. She seems to have unique connections to the Aldean Chancellor, 
          which only makes her all the more mysterious. Can she be trusted?

        <!-- Zach-->
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Zach</button>
      <img src="Zach_image" alt="Zach Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>Zach is a powerful wizard from Hetalia, although he can't remember much from his life before recent.
          Although he has a gift for powerful magic, he doesn't seem to be able to control just how powerful it really gets,
          so each spell he casts causes massive destruction. Because of this, he's typically exhausted after 
          just one spell and finds himself asleep for several hours.
        </p>

         <!-- Jagen-->
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Jagen</button>
      <img src="Jagen_image" alt="Jagen Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>Raised in the towering mountains of Draug, Jagen became a powerful warrior at an early age. He was once
          heralded as a hero among his people, but for some reason he has left that life behind to join forces with Paula
          and her guild. Despite his massive size, he's actually extremely friendly, and unafraid to speak his mind.
        </p>

         <!-- Lord Ibah-->
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Lord Ibah</button>
      <img src="Lord_Ibah_image" alt="Lord Ibah Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>Ibah is the most decorated knight in Aldean history, and the Lord of Ostend. Among his many accomplishments,
          he defended Aldea's northern border from a months long attack from Daedra, and ultimately turned the tides on them,
          securing a stunning victory. Over the rest of his career, his momentum did anything but slow down. He led the march
          on Seruva that brough the conflict to a ceasefire. He was offered a position as the Lord of Radia, the largest
          and grandest province, but instead chose to succeed his late mentor and friend as Lord of the humble Ostend, where
          he married and had two beautiful children, Ezlo and Thalia.

      <img src="Rieke_image" alt="Rieke Image">
        <div class="content">
        <p>An evil force of power, General Rieke is the right hand of the mysterious Aldean Chancellor. His true 
          strength is unknown, but he is known to be very powerful indeed. He seeks to fulfill the wishes of his
          superiors to gain their admiration and glory, but he is unafraid to take matters into his own hands
          when he sees fit.

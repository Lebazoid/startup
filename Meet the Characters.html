    <!-- Ezlo-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Ezlo Image.png" alt="Ezlo Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Ezlo Val Riegan</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The brave young prince of Ostend! He takes pride in the title, and wants to live up to the good name. Since the age of 5 he trained in Ostend's own Knight Academy, and was consistently top of his class. His efforts were acknowledged by his father, Ibah, who began training him with just one other student, Lloyd, at the age of 12. He wields a magical flame blade that casts brilliant flames at enemies, but still he seems to lag behind his classmate - a fact that frustrates him deeply. He dreams of proving himself to, and even surpassing his father.</p>

      <!-- Thalia-->
      <div class="character">
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">
          <img src="Thalia Image.jpeg" alt="Ezlo Image" class="character-image">
          <span class="character-name">Thalia Val Riegan</span>
        </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Ezlo's twin sister, who simultaneously humbles him and pushes him forward. She is jealous that the boys in the castle get to train and learn to fight while she has to learn to be ladylike, so she makes an effort to escape every once in a while and break some rules. She knows nearly everything about everyone in town, and dreams of wielding powerful magic someday, like her father and brother. Although she does not remember her mother, Thalia is often told she looks just like her, minus the striking blonde hair that Ezlo inherited. Together, their appearance honors their mother.</p>

      <!-- Lord Ibah-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Ibah Image.png" alt="Lord Ibah Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Lord Ibah Val Riegan</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Ibah is the most decorated knight in Aldean history, and the Lord of Ostend. Among his many accomplishments, he defended Aldea's northern border from a months-long attack from Daedra, and ultimately turned the tides on them, securing a stunning victory. Over the rest of his career, his momentum did anything but slow down. He led the march on Seruva that brought the conflict to a ceasefire. He was offered a position as the Lord of Radia, the largest and grandest province, but instead chose to succeed his late mentor and friend as Lord of the humble Ostend, where he married and had two beautiful children, Ezlo and Thalia.</p>

    <!-- Hano-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Hano Image.jpeg" alt="Hano Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Hano Black</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Hano is the humble smithing prodigy of Ostend, arising from nothing to be one of the best smiths in the nation. Surpassing his own master at a young age, his work became highly sought after by warriors all around Aldea, so he left his apprenticeship to take personal commissions for all manner of customers - most notably, the enigmatic Lord Ibah. Since he has little family of his own, he considers Ibah's children his siblings, though he is a solid ten years older. He supplies Ostend's best with magnificent weapons and armor, including the adept magical blade that Ezlo wields.</p>

    <!-- Lilian-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Lilian Image.jpeg" alt="Lilian Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Lilian Osbourne</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Lilian Osbourne was born with a deadly, incurable illness. It was only with the help of the greatest doctors in the land, and a little bit of magic that she survived her infancy. As a teen, she became intrigued by the practices that kept her alive, and began studying medicine herself, eventually earning herself the title of 'doctor'. Although she had a very lucrative future ahead of her, she chose to practice in the countryside to help little children like herself, who need access to a doctor. Although she remains burdened by her own illness, she pushes forward with a burning conviction to help others.</p>

    <!-- Orca-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Orca Image.jpeg" alt="Orca Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Orca</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>An old and trusted friend of Lord Ibah. Ibah saved his life in the battles with Daedra back when they were both soldiers, and against Ibah's insistence, Orca has pledged his life to Ibah's service. He sees it as an honor, and takes personal responsibility for the safety of Ibah's children, the prince and princess of Ostend. He overlooked Ezlo's first seven years of training, preparing the young prince for the day that Orca will no longer be able to protect him.</p>

    <!-- Amber-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Amber Image.jpeg" alt="Amber Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Amber Thatcher</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Amber is a young girl who lives peacefully in the countryside, but her heart longs for adventure. Since she was young, she had masterful control of a paintbrush, and her paintings adorn a wall in every palace in Aldea, although she goes by the pseudonym "Vinivier." When she finds Ezlo bruised and battered, she wonders if he will be the knight in shining armor that takes her on her long-awaited adventure.</p>

    <!-- Zach-->

        <img src="Zach Image.png" alt="Zach Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Zachary Carrow</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Zach is a powerful wizard from Hetalia, although he can't remember much from his life before recent. Although he has a gift for powerful magic, he doesn't seem to be able to control just how powerful it really gets, so each spell he casts causes massive destruction. Because of this, he's typically exhausted after just one spell and finds himself asleep for several hours.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Jagen-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Jagen Image.jpeg" alt="Jagen Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Jagen Murdall</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Raised in the towering mountains of Draug, Jagen became a powerful warrior at an early age. He was once heralded as a hero among his people, but for some reason he has left that life behind to join forces with Paula and her guild. Despite his massive size, he's actually extremely friendly, and unafraid to speak his mind.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Paula-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Paula Image.jpeg" alt="Paula Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Paula Megistus</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A mysterious and enigmatic woman with brilliant green hair, and the head of Mila's widely respected mercenary guild. She was raised by monks from a young age, and is adept at many magical arts, including wielding the divine bow Celestia. She seems to have unique connections to the Aldean Chancellor, which only makes her all the more mysterious. Can she be trusted?</p>
      </div>

    <!-- General Rieke-->
    <div class="character">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <img src="Rieke Image.jpeg" alt="Rieke Image" class="character-image">
        <span class="character-name">Roe Rieke</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>An evil force of power, General Rieke is the right hand of the mysterious Aldean Chancellor. His true strength is unknown, but his commanding presence alone is enough to cause many soldiers to fold. He seeks to fulfill the wishes of his superiors to gain their admiration and glory, but he will recklessly take matters into his own hands with no warning. Drunk on his immense power, he is a very dangerous individual. Perhaps that is why the chancellor keeps him so close...</p>

      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The mysterious Aldean Chancellor, whom little is known about. Although his origin is unknown, he became a terrifying magical prodigy at a young age. He spent many years creating allies and working his way up the Aldean military because of his unfathomable accomplishments. Nobody knows where he attained such power. Eventually, he became Chancellor to the King, and the acting steward of the whole nation of Aldea.</p>

        <span class="character-name">Ezlo Val Riegan</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The brave young prince of Ostend! He takes pride in the title, and wants to live up to the good name. Since the age of 5 he trained in Ostend's own Knight Academy, and was consistently top of his class. His efforts were acknowledged by his father, who began training him on his own with another student, Lloyd, at the age of 12. He wields a magical flame blade that casts brilliant flames at enemies, but he seems to lag behind his classmate - a fact that frustrates him deeply. He dreams of surpassing expectations and proving himself to his father.</p>

          <span class="character-name">Thalia Val Riegan</span>
        </button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Ezlo's twin sister, who simultaneously humbles him and pushes him forward. She is jealous that the boys in the castle get to train and learn to fight while she has to learn to be ladylike, so she makes an effort to escape every once in a while and break some rules. Together with Ezlo, she knows nearly everything about everyone in town, and dreams of wielding powerful magic someday, like her father and brother. Although she does not remember her mother, Thalia is often told she looks just like her, minus the striking blonde hair that Ezlo inherited. Together, their appearance honors their mother.</p>

        <span class="character-name">Lord Ibah Val Riegan</span>
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Ibah is the most decorated knight in Aldean history, and the Lord of Ostend. Among his many accomplishments, he defended Aldea's northern border from a months-long attack from Daedra, and ultimately turned the tides on them, securing a stunning victory. Over the rest of his career, his momentum did anything but slow down. He led the march on Seruva that brought the conflict to a ceasefire. He was offered a position as the Lord of Radia, the largest and grandest province, but instead chose to succeed his late mentor and friend as Lord of the humble Ostend, where he married and had two beautiful children, Ezlo and Thalia.</p>

        <p>Amber is a young girl who lives peacefully in the countryside, but her heart longs for adventure.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Zach is a powerful wizard from Hetalia, although he can't remember much from his life before recent. Although he has a gift for powerful magic, he doesn't seem to be able to control just how powerful it really gets, so each spell he casts causes massive destruction. Because of this, he's typically exhausted after just one spell and finds himself asleep for several hours.</p>

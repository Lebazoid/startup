These are the notes for my startup.
Basic things I've learned
* Include a home link in every single header
*  get ready to add a whole lot of images
* Figure out how exactly to do the collapsibles on the 'meet the characters' page. I got close I think, but not quite.
* always be ballin
* Figure out how to configure the interactive map to be well... interactive.
* Figure out how to insert a pdf or something of the first chapter, so that I don't have to format it with html alone
